# Publish Final Document

Once you have completed your document you may still have commands (`//use`, `// notes`, etc ) included in the document. To publish the document without those references, go to the command pallette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and selecte the `MkDocMaker: Publish Document` command. MkDocMaker will generate a new document with the title as name and export all markdown content. Finally it will open it in preview mode for inspection.
