## 1. HOW DO I GET STARTED

Head over to the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Picklejuice.mkdocmaker) or search for "MkDocMaker" in your VS Code extension. Install it and then head over to [https://mkdocmaker.pickle-juice.co.uk/](https://mkdocmaker.pickle-juice.co.uk/) to create an account. Use the same credentials with the extension and you are good to go.

The extension README also describes the process.


## 2. DOES MKDOC MAKER WORK WITH OTHER MARKDOWN EDITORS?

Currently VS Code is the only platform supported. Send us an email though with what integration you would prefer and we will consider it in future.
